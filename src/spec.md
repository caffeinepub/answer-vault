# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the UI to a black and white color theme and improve code experiment presentation by cleaning up formatting, ensuring copyability, and removing excessive descriptive text.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all colors in the UI with a monochromatic black, white, and grayscale palette
- Fix code block formatting to ensure proper indentation, alignment, and monospace font display
- Implement full text selection and copy functionality for code experiments that preserves formatting
- Remove unnecessary descriptive text around code experiments, keeping only experiment titles

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a clean black and white interface with properly formatted, easily readable code experiments that can be fully selected and copied with preserved indentation and formatting.
